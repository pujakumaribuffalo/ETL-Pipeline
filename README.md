Increasing revenue realization by leveraging Big Data


Processing large data volumes in real time
Platform limitations on data crunching speeds prevented real time
inventory forecasting. This led to unutilized inventory and low ad
serving fill rates, which caused significant revenue losses.
Utilizing customer segmentation data for improved ad targeting
Being unable to use customer segmentation data for precise targeting
prevented Opera Mediaworks from charging premium rates from
advertisers as well as increasing their opportunity costs
Re-engineering the product itself to scale for a very high growth
In 2013 over a billion ad requests were processed daily, using over 250
application servers. The business was expecting a 400% growth in the
year 2014 and needed to be equipped to handle this growth.
